- 👋 Hi, I’m @MandricS
- 👀 I only wanna build cool things... I taught myself to code and oh yeah, I'm in Genetics and Business ;)
- 🌱 It's been a long journey starting with SwiftUI, but now I've used React, PostgreSQL, MySQL, TypeScript and Python!
- 💞️ I always love to chat! If you're building something cool or just wanna chat, shoot me an email!
- 📫 Feel free to email me whenever @ [my Ivey email](mailto:msittaro.hba2026@ivey.ca)!
